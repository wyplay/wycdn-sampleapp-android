We explicitly state that no personally identifiable or sensitive personal data related to users is collected, processed, or stored.

### Data Anonymization and User Privacy

All identifiers (peerId, etc.) generated and used by our App are random and anonymous. It is impossible for us to identify any individual user through these identifiers.

### Data Retention Policy

The collected performance measurement data is retained only for a duration of 3 months. After this period, data is automatically and permanently deleted from our systems.

### Purpose of Data Collection

- Monitoring and improving the performance and efficiency of the application.
- Diagnosing and troubleshooting performance-related issues.

### Data Sharing and Disclosure
